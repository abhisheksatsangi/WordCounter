# WordCounter
A simple word counting application. I have provided a dummy translation service which translates all words in a language other than English to English. The word counter uses an internal HashMap to store words as they are being added and later counts occurences of a given word.
I have also provided Junit tests using suitable mocks. The application takes in alphabetical words only.
